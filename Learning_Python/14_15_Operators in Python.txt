Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations.

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)
** (Exponentiation)
// (Floor Division)


Comparison Operators: Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).

== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)



Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. They often combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment.

= (Assignment)
 +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //= (Compound assignments)



 Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements.

and (Logical AND)
or (Logical OR)
not (Logical NOT)


Identity Operators: Used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

is (Returns True if both variables point to the same object)
is not (Returns True if both variables do not point to the same object)
Membership Operators: Used to test if a value or variable is found in a sequence (e.g., string, list, tuple).
in (Returns True if a sequence contains the specified value)
not in (Returns True if a sequence does not contain the specified value)


Bitwise Operators: Used to perform operations on individual bits of integers.

& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
